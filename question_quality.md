### Citation
These three groups are the only living members of the family Equidae.[9] The plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus Hippotigris (C. H. Smith, 1841) in contrast to the Grévy's zebra which was considered the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus (Heller, 1912).[10][11][12] Groves and Bell (2004) placed all three species in the subgenus Hippotigris.[13]

## Question
**Question:** What was the original classification of the quagga?
**Grade:** 2
**Reason:** The question is not specific as there are mutliple answers according to diffrent sources in the text.

### Citation
A 2013 phylogenetic study found that the plains zebra is more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras.[14] The extinct quagga was originally classified as a distinct species.[15] Later genetic studies have placed it as the same species as the plains zebra, either a subspecies or just the southernmost population.[16][17]

## Question
**Question:** What did a 2017 mitochondrial DNA study find about zebras and asses?
**Grade:** 3
**Reason:** The question is not specific as there are mutliple answers according to diffrent sources in the text.

### Citation
[21] A 2017 mitochondrial DNA study placed the Eurasian Equus ovodovi and the subgenus Sussemionus lineage as closer to zebras than to asses.[22] However, other studies disputed this placement, finding the Sussemionus lineage basal to the zebra+asses group, but suggested that the Sussemionus lineage may have received gene flow from zebras

## Question
**Question:** What happened to the quagga?
**Grade:** 3
**Reason:** The question is not specific as there are mutliple answers according to diffrent sources in the text.

### Citation
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists Grévy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. The quagga (E. quagga quagga), a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.
