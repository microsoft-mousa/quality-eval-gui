### Citation
These three groups are the only living members of the family Equidae.[9] The plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus Hippotigris (C. H. Smith, 1841) in contrast to the Grévy's zebra which was considered the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus (Heller, 1912).[10][11][12] Groves and Bell (2004) placed all three species in the subgenus Hippotigris.[13]

### Citation
A 2013 phylogenetic study found that the plains zebra is more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras.[14] The extinct quagga was originally classified as a distinct species.[15] Later genetic studies have placed it as the same species as the plains zebra, either a subspecies or just the southernmost population.[16][17]

## Answer
**Answer:** Promiscuous
**Grade:** 1
**Reject Reason:** wrind answer - misunderstanding of the context in which the answer word is used, leading to an incorrect answer to the question.
**Note:** The answer present is wrong as it is taken literally. There is a meaning of the word "Promiscuous" that is not the required answer.

### Citation
Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions.

## Answer
**Answer:** Deterrent for biting flies
**Grade:** 4
**Reject Reason:** Incomplete answer - there are indications there are other interpretations.
**Note:** The answer would be better if it indicated that this is the leading series.

### Citation
Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these patterns, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.
